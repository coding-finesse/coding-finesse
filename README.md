 My Story: "Progress, not perfection. I am a third-year undergraduate
 student pursuing Computer Engineering.
 I have always admired the world of technology, and here I am,
 pursuing my dream career.
 Developers and engineers have always been my superheroes."

"I am a firm believer in Women in Tech and using STEM for Social Good. 
I recently represented India at Girl Up's STEM for Social Good Tour hosted 
a fireside chat with Ms. Lauren Neal, Vice President, Booz Allen Hamilton, USA."

"As I move ahead with my technical journey, I want to be more purposeful in my 
contributions to the tech community and many people who share the same dream, 
to be a great developer from one day to day one!."
