 My Story: "Progress, not perfection. As a child, everyone dreams of a very elated future with luxury, popularity, and success. But, as age climbs, the dreams get replaced by practical goals. In the next ten years, I will have lived across Asia and Europe, bombarding my socials with my own version of TLC and a breath-taking book collection. While at it I aspire to pursue specialization in Data Science and explore all avenues of business administration & financial management."

"Meanwhile, making good use of my bachelors in Computer Engineering, and becoming a Thoughtful leader of the workplace, motivated and passionate about building companies and organisations from within and to contribute to the team’s success."

"My social projects have been acknowledged by notable organizations including Girl Up Foundation and were featured among 14 Indian Community leaders this International Women's Day."

"So far so good ,At times Being the only woman or the youngest person in the room, I have embraced challenges, won over difficult clients and am passionate about discovering new technical advances,the power and drive of innovation it brings along.With a question of 'How can we get more women into STEM degree programs and careers?' to address.
